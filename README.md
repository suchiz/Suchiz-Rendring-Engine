# Suchiz-Rendring-Engine

Requieres at least OpenGL 3.3, Qt 4.7 and C++11
This is a small 3D Engine made for a university project purpose.

This contains a Blinn-Phong lightning and shadowmaps for the rendering part.
You have the possibility to create your own scene, or use the demo scene.

Operations available: Draw a cube, draw a plane, draw a sphere, draw a nurbs surface while playing with the color, and the position.
More: You can modify nurbs surfaces, and move the light.

Usage:

Z/Q/S/D to move the camera, and click and rotate to change the view.
If move light is ticked, the light will do some circle, then use Z/Q/S/D to increase the height and the distance.
If you let a blank, the default values are: 
Size = 1, color = (1,1,1), position = (0,0,0), rotation = (0,0,0) for objects
height = 3, width = 3, color = (1,1,1), position = (0,0,0) for nurbs
